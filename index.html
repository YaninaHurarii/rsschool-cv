        <h1>Web CV - Yanina Hurarii</h1>
        <p>I joined Front-end development in 2023. During this time, I learned the basic web technologies: HTML, CSS, Git etc. I'm also continuing my self-education - I'm studying different approaches to responsive layout and trying them out in practice. I like to work on projects that require a lot of concentration, teamwork, coming up with new ideas, learning new technologies and approaches to solving tasks. I can work both independently and in a team.
